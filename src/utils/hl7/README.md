# About HL7 

## Before You Begin

It is important to read the entirety of this document.  Skipping portions of it
may result in an unnecessary implementation burden on you or your team.  It is
important to note that the definition of required may not mean it is required
for you but, rather, required in the context of a complete messaging solution as
you will see illustrated below. The use of certain segments can be 
context-dependent. 

For example, the PV1 segment (segments are defined in the following content) is 
commonly used in patient administration messages but may not be required in all 
lab reporting scenarios. In the context of voluntary at-home testing, there 
wouldn't be an associated order from a healthcare provider, which would 
typically be represented in the ORC (Common Order) segment, but you may include
it to carry additional information to the final destination such as the status 
of the result being preliminary, final, etc. 

It's always recommended to consult the HL7 standard or implementation guide for 
your specific use case and the receiver's requirements.  So, again, please read
the entirety of this document, consult with your particular partner or vendor,
and ensure you are sending the necessary information to fulfill your 
implementation requirements as well as the spirit of any integration you are
performing.

As for this library, it will require you to minimally provide information about
the patient, the test, and the test reult.  

## What is HL7
Health Level Seven (HL7) is a set of international standards for the exchange,
integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic health information. These
standards define how information is packaged and communicated from one party to
another, setting the language, structure, and data types required for seamless
integration between systems.

HL7 exists to facilitate interoperability between different healthcare systems
and software applications. It was established to address the need for a more
efficient way to share data, reduce redundancy and errors, and ensure that
disparate healthcare systems can talk to each other and share relevant patient
information securely and accurately.

In the realm of HL7, messages are the primary vehicle for data exchange. An HL7
message is made up of several segments. Each segment consists of a series of
composable units known as fields. Each segment begins with a three-character
string that identifies the segment type. For example, an MSH segment is a
message header segment, a PID segment carries patient identification data, and
an OBR segment contains observation request information.

The message always starts with an MSH segment, which identifies the type and
purpose of the message. Other segments follow, each carrying different kinds of
data.

Segments are arranged in a hierarchical manner to form trees known as "groups."
Groups can contain multiple segments or other groups, allowing complex
relationships of data to be represented.

Each segment in the message is separated by a carriage return, and within each
segment, the fields are delimited using a defined character, often the pipe
character (|). The data within the fields are further subdivided using various
other delimiters, such as the caret (^).

An HL7 message is essentially a structured string of text, divided into
segments, fields, components, and sub-components, designed to carry all the
necessary healthcare information for a particular transaction or event. The
specific structure and content of the message depend on the type of event being
communicated and the specific requirements of the systems exchanging the
information.

HL7 version 2.5.1 is a specific release of the HL7 standard that introduced
various enhancements to support evolving healthcare information needs. Like its
predecessors, it uses a text-based, segment-structured format for data exchange.

## About the HL7 ELR Message
Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) is a specific type of HL7 v2.5.1 message
used to communicate laboratory test results from laboratories to public health
agencies. The need for ELR has been highlighted by public health events such as
the COVID-19 pandemic, where rapid, accurate reporting of test results is vital
for monitoring and response efforts.

An ELR message contains segments for various types of information:

- The MSH (Message Header) segment provides information about the message
itself, such as the message type and the sender and receiver of the message.
- The PID (Patient Identification) segment carries patient demographic
information.
- The OBR (Observation Request) and OBX (Observation Result) segments carry the
test order and result information, respectively.
- The SPM (Specimen) segment provides details about the sample that was tested.
- Additional segments like PV1 (Patient Visit), ORC (Common Order), NK1 (Next of
Kin / Associated Parties), and others can provide further context and detail as
needed.

The use of a standardized message format like HL7 v2.5.1 ELR helps ensure that
the transmitted information is interpretable by different systems, regardless of
the specific software or hardware used by the laboratory or public health
agency. This enables rapid, automated, accurate reporting and analysis of
laboratory test results, which is vital for public health monitoring and
response.

### ELR Message Segments
To simplify implementation, this library focuses on certain segments within the 
HL7 2.5.1 ELR message.  Certain segments are denoted as required while others
are flagged as recommended.  Please note required is a hard word to define
within HL7 and a segment may be denoted as required here but may not be
necessary to fulfill your integration requirements with a partner.

_This library requires you to provide, minimally, information necessary to fill
out the PID, OBR, and OBX segments._

Below is a brief summary of some of the required and recommended segments in an
HL7 v2.5.1 Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR) message.  Please refer to the
latest NIST guidance when sending ELR messages to a RADx compliant hub.

**Required Segments:**

- MSH (Message Header): This segment is always the first in any HL7 message. It
contains metadata about the message itself, such as who is sending, who is
intended to receive the message, and what type of message it is.

- SFT (Software Segment): This segment provides details about the software that
generated the message, including software vendor organization, software
certified version or release number. This segment is recommended as it helps in
troubleshooting and system compatibility checks.

- PID (Patient Identification): This segment includes patient demographic
information such as ID, name, date of birth, sex, and address. It serves as a
unique identifier for the patient across different healthcare systems.

- ORC (Common Order): This segment carries information about the order details.
It includes order control codes, order status, and ordering provider
information.

- OBR (Observation Request): This segment holds details about the lab test
order, including the test requested, order details, and result status.

- OBX (Observation Result): This segment contains the actual results from the
lab test, including test identifier, results, units, and reference ranges.

- SPM (Specimen): This segment provides details about the sample that was
tested, such as specimen ID, specimen type, and specimen collection and handling
details.

These segments are enumerated below and focus on the primary fields within each
segment.
